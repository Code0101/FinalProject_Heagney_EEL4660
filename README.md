Final Project OpenCV Face Tracking Camera code for EEL 4660
The python code uses a combination of OpenCV functions and python functions to create a program that will track a face
moving in front of a webcamera.

The arduino code takes a number value passed from the python code and uses that number value to determine
where to move a servo attached to the webcamera.

The xml file is a file called from the python code that is used for the face tracking.
